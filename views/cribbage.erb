      These benches evolved from the ninety-degree curves that make up RoadWorks.
      Colored concrete and stainless steel benches provide outdoor seating and an opportunity
      for visitors and workers to interact in games of cribbage. The curvilinear benches allude
      to roads, and the cribbage markers to vehicles on the roads.
