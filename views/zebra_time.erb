    <p>
      My first endeavor with Ruby on Rails, the road to ZebraTime began with
      a QuickBooks consultant inquiring of my friend Mike Raney about the possibility of making an online timesheet
      for her customers.
    </p>
    <p>      
      I was new to web applications but was interested in the timesheet project, partly because I had an employee
      and could use it for my business, and partly because I wanted to learn to write software for the web.
      Mike writes web apps in Java so he dove right in. While I thought Java would be easy to learn with my
      C++ background, I scanned the web for the latest and best in web development; it was not long before
      Rails won me over.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was intrigued by the Ruby language, and immediately impressed with the amount of helpful information
      available on the web. I studied in earnest, applying what I learned to the timesheet app. We each worked hundreds of
      hours in our spare time. By the end of the year I had some grasp of what I was doing and each of us
      were at a similar point in development. And it was clear that Rails had made it easy for me to do things
      Mike had spent hours with in Java...

    <p>
      Because he's a good friend and a nice guy, Mike agreed to learn Rails and started
      working with me on the Rails version of the timesheet; in a few months we had the timesheet up and running
      on a server (see screenshot). After a two-year hiatus we are diving back into the project, to build our chops,
      and perhaps get more serious about a business plan.
    </p>
    </p>
      When working on the schema I thought I had a pretty good handle on 3-Normal database design; 
      coming back to it now I see it needs a lot of work... We will be refactoring everything and
      building a test suite.

      Mike and I have worked on other projects together, too. <a href="http://www.westseattleherald.com/2011/04/08/news/slideshow-wayfinding-kiosks-going-around-west-sea">West Seattle Wayfinding Kiosks - West Seattle Herald Article </a>
