      a combination that tests the <br />robustness of the design.

      High-side switches keep the solenoid valves at zero potential unless activated, minimizing corrosion. A remote
      temperature sensor signals the water system to winterize: shut down and drain when temperature is near freezing. A power
      outage signals a switch to battery power, initiates winterization sequence, then power off.
