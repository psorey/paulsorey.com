        <em>Salmon Waves</em> celebrates the (largely invisible) improvements made to the 
        Locks to increase the survival rate of young smolt migrating downstream to Puget Sound
        and the ocean.

        Seagulls, herons, sea lions, sailboats, yachts, barges, and fascinating feats of engineering
        make the "Ballard Locks"
        a favorite venue for tourists and locals alike. It is easy, however, to overlook the overarching
        importance of water,
        tumbling from the Cascades and flowing into Puget Sound, and the migrations of salmon
        from freshwater streams to ocean
        and back.

        The migrating salmon are fleeting and transitory; images of swimming
        smolt are generated by single rows of LED lights and digital electronics. 
        The smolt migrate nocturnally; the fish images are visible
        only at night. And there is a bit of mystery
        about the rows of blue lights and what they do -- even people who visit at night
        sometimes need to be shown how to see the fish.

        The roaring sound
        of water crashing over the spillway provides the auditory
        experience for the artwork.

        <p>Sorey likes to make his artworks self-explanatory in some ways: the story of how the waves
        were constructed is told by the 3,000 screws fastening
        the pieces together, and a peek inside the structures through gaps between
        the metal sides reveals the lack of internal structure.

        <p>An angle grinder was used to apply texture to the surface,
        creating a watery, three-dimensional appearance in sunlight. The
        stainless steel picks up color from the surrounding environment
        which changes constantly with the time of day and the season.</p>
        
        <p>Sorey enjoys inventing tools that facilitate the artmaking process:
        he wrote his own 3-D computer software to aid in design and construction of these and other artworks.</p>
