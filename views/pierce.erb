    This kinetic artwork, with no moving parts, hangs in the entrance lobby atrium of 
    a new Pierce County Public Works Facility. The sculpture is an abstraction of a roadway system
    with side streets and arterials. LED-lit translucent boxes glow in sequence to convey the motion
    of vehicles along the roads.

    A randomly varying number of vehicles is present on the system at one time, and each vehicle has
    its own behavior which the viewer can appreciate over time.
